## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate full stack developer with 20 years of experience in making all kinds of programs.
I'm currently working for multiple companies as a developer and consultant.
I love to learn new things and I'm always looking for new challenges. I live in **Czechia**
but I'm drawn towards USA and Australia, probably due to my love for sharks and crocodiles.
